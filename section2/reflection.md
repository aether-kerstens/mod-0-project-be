## Section 2 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?
The first point that stuck in my head was the S.M.A.R.T. method - Setting Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-Bound goals helps you to approach learning to code with clarity, focus, and use of appropriate strategies. There's a great deal about slowly training and growing your Zone of Promximal Development to shift and develop your own mindset. Very much a "Rome wasn't built in a day" method. Another key point is that seeking help is not a sign of weakness nor is struggling to succeed when face with obstacles - rather its a sign of strength and resilience. Both points are something that I have long been aware of but rarely have I ever had it put so clearly before me.
2. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
In one way I currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset by seeking help with my own issues that I know I am aware of through counselling and such - and I am challenging myself insofar of taking this course. However I also am aware that I shy away from challenge often and due to childhood trauma see asking questions as a weakness and a shame still. I also do punish myself unproportionately even when the mess up is a simple line of code or less.
3. What is a conditional statement? Give three examples.
A conditional statement are decision/logic gates that make decisions based on certain conditions being fulfilled.
if cars > people
if sky_is_blue = true
if cats > dogs
4. Why might you want to use an if-statement?
To check if a conditiona rings true and depending on the decision render two choices.
5. What is the Ruby syntax for an if statement?
if condition [then]
6. How do you add multiple conditions to an if statement?
We can nest multiple elsif and else statements within an if statement.
7. Provide an example of the Ruby syntax for an if/elsif/else statement:
if condition [then]
   code...
elsif condition [then]
   code
else
   code
end
