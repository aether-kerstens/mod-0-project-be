## Section 3 Reflection

1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?
The pomodoro has 100% boosted my efficiency, as it actually reinforces
2. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?
It went so so - Pomodoro has greatly helped my focus and pacing myself - but I still run the risk of ignoring Pomodoro's mandated breaks and thus risking burnout which has happened several times. The tasks took both more time and less time then estimated. I was both more focused on my studies but also more distracted during my breaks.
3. What is a Hash, and how is it different from an Array?
A Hash stores values in an unordered manner but they are paired with keys, whereas the Array stores only values alone, but in an ordered list. Hashes are also to a certain degree like strings within strings.
4. In the space below, create a Hash stored to a variable named `pet_store`.  This hash should hold an inventory of items and the number of that item that you might find at a pet store.
`pet_store = {food_bowls: 5, cages: 3, pet_food: 20}`
5. Given the following `states = {"CO" => "Colorado", "IA" => "Iowa", "OK" => "Oklahoma"}`, how would you access the value `"Iowa"`?
`puts states["IA"]`
6. With the same hash above, how would we get all the keys?  How about all the values?
For the keys it would be: `puts states.keys`
For the values it would be: `puts states.values`
7. What is another example of when we might use a hash?  In your example, why is a hash better than an array?
We might use a hash in establishing families, with first name paired to a last name - it would be better than an array as the array would be unable to distinguish all the families from each other unlike a hash.
8. What questions do you still have about hashes?
It took me a while to realize that `:` and `=>` are both hashes and I briefly confused them with arrays - as well as mistyping `=>` as `>=` which is a greater-or-equal-than. Why are the hashes so complicated/different - is it a carry over from past editions? Why does the Learn ruby switch different formats - yes it helps prepare for the real world but it is confusing without explanation - still though it is appreciated.
