## Section 1 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?
Even though I know that we are to a point encouraged to ask questions, I've been burned too many times by authority figures belittling me for asking questions. However the blog posts remind me that even though there can be a lot of perceived shame and stigma to asking questions, especially out of the fear of being shamed, we should still ask those questions. There have been many times where I knew the answer but kept quiet and my hand lowered out of fear that it was the wrong answer - though it was not. However as these articles have shown - sometimes the best way to ask questions depends on the time and place, as well as sometimes talking it through or googling it beforehand. We can get easily stuck in self-negative loops trapped in our head. Trying to "pick yourself up by the bootstraps" or prove you're "independent" often times just a waste of time borne from fear that prevents efficiency and learning. Indeed there is a great social stigma on asking for help - but this class, career, and posts would say otherwise.
2. How would you print the string `"Hello World!"` to the terminal?
p "Hello World!"
puts "Hello World!"
prints "Hello World!"
3. What character is used to indicate comments in a ruby file?
The # is called the octothorpe.
4. Explain the difference between an integer and a float?
An integer is a number without a decimal point and is more general information while floats contain decimal points as well being used for when precision is needed.
5. In the space below, create a variable `animal` that holds the string `"zebra"`
animal = "zebra"
6. How would you print the string `"zebra"` using the variable that you created above?
p animal
p #{animal}
7. What is interpolation? Use interpolation to print a sentence using the variable `animal`.
p "The #{animal} is often found in the wild."
8. What method is used to get input from a user?
gets.chomp
9. Name and describe two common string methods:
For long lists you can use .pop to delete the last value in the list. You can also have the user input their own data (sort of like pythons float(input())!) but for ruby you would use get.chomp
